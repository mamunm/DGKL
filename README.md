[![ChemRxiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/ChemRxiv-Latest-blue.svg)](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/67dc2d6381d2151a022b2aad)

DGKL is a deep graph kernel learning framework for uncertainty quantification in catalysis, specifically designed for accurate prediction and uncertainty estimation of adsorption energies in heterogeneous catalysis.

## üöÄ Environment Setup
- System requirements: This package requires a Linux computer with GPU. The codes have been tested on NVIDIA GPUs (A100 on CAC cluster, V100 on Expanse cluster, and RTX 4060 on local machine).
- We use `poetry` for dependency management. Key dependencies include:
  - Python 3.10+
  - PyTorch with CUDA support
  - PyTorch Geometric
  - GPyTorch
  - ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)
  - PyTorch Lightning
  - Weights & Biases (optional)

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Poetry installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
